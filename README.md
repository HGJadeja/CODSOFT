# Codsoft Internship Java Tasks

This repository contains the solutions for the three tasks assigned during the Codsoft Internship. The tasks are implemented in Java.

## Table of Contents
1. [Guess the Number](https://github.com/HGJadeja/CODSOFT/blob/main/task1_NumberGame.java)
2. [Student Grade Calculator](https://github.com/HGJadeja/CODSOFT/blob/main/task1_NumberGame.java)
3. [ATM Interface](https://github.com/HGJadeja/CODSOFT/blob/main/task3_ATM_Interface.java)

## Guess the Number
A simple number guessing game. The user has 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

## Student Grade Calculator
A program that calculates the grades of students based on their scores. The program takes the scores of the students as input and calculates their grades according to the grading criteria.

## ATM Interface
A simple ATM interface that allows users to deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. The program ensures that users cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account.

## How to Run
Each task is implemented in its own Java file. You can run each file separately using the Java compiler (javac) and interpreter (java).
